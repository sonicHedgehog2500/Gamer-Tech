				The Nintendo Switch is a portable, hybrid home console combining characteristics of 
				Nintendo Wii and Wii U while outlining additional functionality unfamiliar to other systems. 
				Components of the Nintendo Switch consist of a Console, Dock and wireless Joy-Con controllers 
				enabling adjustments to various gameplay modes. Thus, empowering individuals in adjusting this 
				system to their requirements and those alongside them. Therefore, enabling individuals to find 
				their ideal gaming mode consisting of TV, Table Top and Handheld mode.

			</div>
			<p>
				The Console is Nintendo Switch&apos;s main component providing a graphical user interface for individuals 
				to interact with. Also, the Console possesses an easily detachable LCD display providing touchscreen 
				features. In addition, a detachable display demonstrates repairs can be conducted easily compared to 
				other systems where displays are built-in. Therefore, the Console has considered simplifying repairs 
				towards damaged LCDs. The Console possesses a various hardware enabling it to function and consists of:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inner Black Cover.</li>
					<li>Outer Black Cover.</li>
					<li>Battery.</li>
					<li>Main Chassis.</li>
					<li>Speakers.</li>
					<li>Display.</li>
					<li>Front Panel / Digitiser.</li>
					<li>Fan.</li>
					<li>Motherboard.</li>
					<li>Joy-Con Attachment Rail.</li>
					<li>Game Card Reader / Headphone Jack.</li>
					<li>SD Card Holder.</li>
					<li>Memory Daugtherboard.</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="sub-container">

					<p>
						The Motherboard is the Console&apos;s core hardware. This component uses a Tegra X1-based SoC (System On A Chip) 
						possessing 8 cores of processing power. But, only 4 cores are used at one time. Thus, minimising power 
						consumption to the Nintendo Switch. Therefore, enabling the Nintendo Switch to function longer which provides 
						larger time periods of gameplay.
					</p>

					<p>
						Additional components are also housed on the Motherboard. A BCM4356 wireless chip providing WiFi and Bluetooth. 
						Furthermore, the Console is identified to possess an STMicrolectronics LSM6DS3 3D accelerometer and gyroscope. Thus, 
						providing the Nintendo Switch with its motion sensing technology.

				<img src="Images/nintendoSwitch/dockBack.png" alt="dockBack">
			</div>
			<p>
				The Dock is an essential component for enabling Nintendo Switch&apos;s TV mode style of gameplay. Also, this Dock operates 
				as a station for charging the Console. Furthermore, the Dock&apos;s back is a cover which when opened, reveals additional 
				connecting ports consisting of AC Adapter, USB and HDMI ports. Therefore, demonstrating this component as a USB-C hub 
				providing the console while generating HDMI / USB output.

				<img src="Images/nintendoSwitch/consoleUSB.png" alt="consoleUSB">
			</div>
				<p>
					Internally, the Dock contains a circuit board enabling connections with these ports. Furthermore, where the Console slides in, 
					contains a USB connector. Going back to the Console, underneath is a USB connection in the middle.

			<h1>Wireless Joy-Con Controllers</h1>
				<img src="Images/nintendoSwitch/joyCons.png" alt="joyCons" class="floatLeft">
				<p>
					Based on appearance of these Joy-Cons demonstrate much similarities to controllers used by Nintendo Wii. Also, these Joy-Cons 
					are separable from the main Console and demonstrates capabilities of a traditional gamepad.
				</p>

				<div class="sub-container">

					<img src="Images/nintendoSwitch/joyConInfradRedCam.png" alt="joyConInfraRedCam">
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Both Joy-Cons to possess identical components. For example, both possess lithium-ion batteries enabling 20 hours maximum battery 
					life contributing to providing longer periods of gameplay identical to how the STMicrolectronics LSM6DS3 3D accelerometer and gyroscope 
					minimise power consumption. Subsequently, connecting both Joy-Cons use CYW20734 Bluetooth Transceivers enabling a connection with the 
					main Console via Bluetooth connectivity. One Joy-Con demonstrates itself to contain an infra-red camera to detect various hand shapes 
					enabling new modes of interaction.
				</p>

			<h1>TV Mode</h1>
			<img src="Images/nintendoSwitch/tvMode.png" alt="tvMode" class="floatLeft">
			<p>
				TV mode enables Nintendo Switch to be used as a traditional games console via connecting the Console with a Dock. The Dock is a required 
				component for enabling TV mode. Upon connecting with a TV, the Dock can be connected with the Console which then displays picture through 
				TV. Also, the Console alone provides 720p image quality. But, displays 1080p quality when connecting to the dock. This quality is achieved 
				by the TV power draw through a wall outlet. TV mode gameplay is achieved by connecting the Dock to a TV system. When this is done, the 
				Console can be connected to a Dock. Subsequently, the Console transmits video signals to display picture through the connected TV. Also, 
				while connected to a Dock, the Console&apos;s battery will be charged enabling longer gameplay periods in TV mode while the Console is 
				connected to a Dock.  
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="sub-container">
			<h1>Table Top Mode</h1>
			<img src="Images/nintendoSwitch/tableTopMode.png" alt="tableTopMode" class="floatLeft">
			<p>
				Table Top mode stands the Nintendo Switch and both Joy-Cons are disconnected from the main Console confirming wireless connectivity to be
				applied in this mode of gameplay. Whether using one or both Joy-Cons, individuals share the experience in single and multiplayer 
				experience. Also, screen output of this mode is demonstrated to be through the main Console. The STMicrolectronics LSM6DS3 3D 
				accelerometer and gyroscope in these Joy-Cons enable motion movement functionality. Through this, the Console&apos;s STMicrolectronics 
				LSM6DS3 3D accelerometer and gyroscope captures these movements to reproduce them onscreen. Similarly, button presses must be enabled 
				via Bluetooth connectivity. The Cypress CYW20734 Bluetooth Transciever within these Joy-Cons, transmits data to the Cypress BCM4356 
				wireless chip within the Console. Thus, transmitting data to the Console explaining actions to be performed in a game.
			</p>

			<h1>Handheld Mode</h1>
			<div class="sub-container">

				<img src="Images/nintendoSwitch/joyConPlasticSlider.png" alt="joyConPlasticSlider">
			</div>
			<p>
				Hanheld mode shows the Nintendo Switch to be used by hand. Also, both Joy-Cons are connected to the main Console enabling individuals to 
				enjoy this experience on the go whereever desired. Table Top mode also allows this system to be usable in any location. One of the Consoles 
				many components is attachment rails which connect on opposite ends of the Console providing firm grip for both Joy-Cons. Both attachments 
				being metal provides a firm grip when both Joy-Con connect to the Console. The Joy-Cons have plastic slider enabling an easy slide in 
				connection. These rails also possess a set of pins connecting with contacts on the Joy-Cons. This enables a ribbon cable on the attachment 
				rail to pass button presses to the Motherboard.
